        <h1 class="titlecolor">Fijian Cuisine</h1>
        <p style="padding-top: 1vh;">Fiji is better known for its beaches rather than its cuisine. However, this small island nation still has a rich culinary heritage. 
            Traditional cooking methods consist of cooking over an open fire or in an underground oven. The large Indo-Fijian community has left 
            a lasting impact on the country’s food. Many Indians came to Fiji in the 1870s as indentured servants who worked in this former British 
            colony’s sugarcane industry. They introduced many curries and chilies that make this Pacific island nation’s cuisine distinct from its 
            neighbors. Sweet potato, rice, cassava, coconut, fish, and taro (a starchy root vegetable similar to yam) is used to create amazing 
            Fijian dishes. Whether served by locals while you stay a rental, or whether you try it out served at a resort in Fiji, you shouldn’t 
            miss out on the opportunity to try these dishes. To sum up, no matter where you stay in Fiji, don’t miss out on these traditional Fiji 
            food when you’re in the country.

                <p>​Topoi is a Fijian dumpling made with grated cassava and coconut, coconut milk or cream, and sugar. The sweet cassava mixture is 
                    typically shaped into balls, which are then simmered in a pot of boiling water until soft and thoroughly cooked. Once boiled, 
                    the cassava dumplings are taken out, and the remaining water is further cooked with additional grated cassava and coconut milk 
                    until it has thickened to a porridge-like consistency. Topoi is a typical Fijian breakfast that is usually accompanied by butter, 
                    jam, and a cup of steaming tea on the side.</p>
